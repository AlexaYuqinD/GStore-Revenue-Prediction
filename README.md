# GStore-Revenue-Prediction

Here are the functions of our codes: 

**explore.ipynb:** preprocess raw data, obtain training and test set

**GStore-data+visualization.ipynb:** implement exploratory data analysis, visualize the distributions and relations of features

**BuildModels.ipynb:** train and tune the following models: classification models including logistic regression and lightGBM, regression models including linear regression, lightGBM, XGBoost and CatBoost, combined pipelines of classification and regression models, integrated lightGBM model.
 
**DNN Model.ipynb:** train and tune DNN classifier and regressor using Tensorflow 1.7.

**naive_bayes.py:** train and tune Naive Bayes using sklearn packages. Feature selection was done manually. The main method allows changing of weights on the positive class samples.

The outputs of the codes have been saved in the jupyter notebooks.
