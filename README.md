# GStore-Revenue-Prediction

Here are the functions of our codes: 

**explore.ipynb:** Preprocessed raw data, obtained training and test set

**GStore-data+visualization.ipynb:** Implemented exploratory data analysis, visualized the distributions and relations of features

**BuildModels.ipynb:** trained and tuned the following models: classification models including logistic regression and lightGBM, regression models including linear regression, lightGBM, XGBoost and CatBoost, combined pipelines of classification and regression models, integrated lightGBM model.
 
**DNN Model.ipynb:** trained and tuned DNN classifier and regressor using Tensorflow 1.7.

**naive_bayes.py:** trained and tuned Naive Bayes using sklearn packages. Feature selection was done manually. The main method allows changing of weights on the positive class samples.

The outputs of the codes have been saved in the jupyter notebook.
